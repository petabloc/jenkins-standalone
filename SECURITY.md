# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Jenkins Standalone follows a security-first approach with automated monitoring and updates.

| Component | Version | Security Support | Auto-Updates |
|-----------|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Jenkins Core | 2.426.1 (LTS) | ✅ Active | Daily scan, Critical auto-PR |
| OpenJDK | 21.0.1 | ✅ Active | Daily scan, Security patches |
| Core Plugins | Latest stable | ✅ Active | Daily scan, Security patches |

## Version Management

### Automated Security Monitoring

- **Daily Scans**: GitHub Actions check for security advisories
- **Critical Alerts**: Immediate notification and automated PR creation
- **Vulnerability Database**: Integration with Jenkins security advisories and CVE databases

### Update Process

1. **Detection**: Automated daily security scans
2. **Assessment**: Severity classification (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
3. **Testing**: Build verification in CI environment
4. **Deployment**: 
   - Critical: Automated PR creation
   - High: 24-hour notification cycle
   - Medium/Low: Weekly maintenance cycle

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### For Jenkins Standalone Project Issues

1. **Do not** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Send security reports to the repository maintainers via GitHub Security Advisories
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fixes (if known)

### For Upstream Component Vulnerabilities

- **Jenkins Core**: Report to [Jenkins Security Team](https://www.jenkins.io/security/)
- **OpenJDK**: Report to [OpenJDK Vulnerability Group](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/vulnerability/)
- **Plugins**: Report to individual plugin maintainers or Jenkins Security Team

## Security Features

### Build Security

- **Reproducible Builds**: All versions pinned in `versions.yml`
- **Checksum Verification**: Downloads verified against known checksums
- **Source Integrity**: All downloads from official sources only
- **Build Isolation**: No external dependencies during runtime

### Runtime Security

- **Minimal Attack Surface**: Only required components included
- **Non-root Execution**: Runs as non-privileged user
- **Isolated Environment**: Self-contained in project directory
- **Security Defaults**: Conservative security configuration

### Monitoring and Response

- **Automated Scanning**: Daily vulnerability assessments
- **Security Reports**: Detailed vulnerability analysis
- **Update Tracking**: Complete audit trail of version changes
- **Rollback Capability**: Previous versions maintained for quick rollback

## Security Configuration

### Default Security Posture

Jenkins Standalone ships with security **disabled** by default for ease of local development. For production use:

```bash
# Enable security in Jenkins
# Edit jenkins_home/config.xml and set:
<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
<authorizationStrategy class="hudson.security.GlobalMatrixAuthorizationStrategy"/>
<securityRealm class="hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm"/>
```

### Recommended Production Settings

1. **Authentication**: Enable user-based authentication
2. **Authorization**: Implement role-based access control
3. **HTTPS**: Use reverse proxy with TLS termination
4. **Network Security**: Restrict access to trusted networks
5. **Regular Updates**: Enable automated security updates

### Air-Gapped Environments

For high-security, disconnected environments:

1. **Pre-build Security**: Include all security patches at build time
2. **Offline Scanning**: Use `./scripts/security-scan.sh` for local assessment
3. **Version Control**: Track all component versions in `versions.yml`
4. **Manual Updates**: Process security updates through change control

## Security Tools

### Built-in Security Scripts

```bash
# Security vulnerability scan
./scripts/security-scan.sh --severity high

# Check for security updates
./scripts/update-versions.sh --security-only --dry-run

# Generate security report
./scripts/security-scan.sh --format json > security-report.json
```

### GitHub Actions Security Workflows

- **Daily Security Scan**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Critical Update PR**: Automatic PR creation for critical vulnerabilities
- **Security Report**: Weekly comprehensive security assessment
- **Version Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all components

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

- **P0 - Critical**: RCE, Authentication bypass, Data exposure
- **P1 - High**: Privilege escalation, Information disclosure
- **P2 - Medium**: DoS, Limited information disclosure
- **P3 - Low**: Minor security improvements

### Response Timeline

- **P0 Critical**: Immediate response (< 4 hours)
- **P1 High**: Same day response (< 24 hours)
- **P2 Medium**: Weekly maintenance cycle
- **P3 Low**: Monthly maintenance cycle

### Communication

1. Security advisory creation in GitHub
2. Update notification in repository releases
3. Documentation updates in SECURITY.md
4. Version tracking in versions.yml

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Trail

- All version changes tracked in git history
- Security scan reports timestamped and archived
- Update decisions documented in PR descriptions
- Vulnerability assessments stored as artifacts

### Compliance Standards

- **NIST**: Follows NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines
- **OWASP**: Incorporates OWASP security best practices
- **CIS**: Aligns with CIS security benchmarks where applicable

## Contact

- **Security Issues**: Use GitHub Security Advisories
- **General Questions**: Create GitHub Issues with 'security' label
- **Emergency Contact**: Repository maintainers via GitHub
